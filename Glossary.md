## Causal model
> A causal model is a diagram of the relationships between independent, control, and dependent variables.

## Child
A variable $Y$ is a child of variable $X$ if there is a unidirectional path from $X$ to $Y$.

## Collider

## Confounder
A variable ($Z$) that is a common cause of an exposure ($a$) and an outcome ($Y$). This is described as a bias that can result in spurious correlation between.

## Conditioning
[[Conditioning]] refers to setting a parent variable to a specific value, which has the effect of changing the value of a child variable.

## Counterfactual

## Covariate
A covariate is a variable included in a study of cause and effect that is not the exposure variable ($X$) nor the outcome variable ($Y$). A covariate is typically indicated by use of a lower case alphabetical symbol, e.g. $a$. 

## d-separation
> d-separation is a criterion for deciding, from a given a causal graph, whether a set $X$ of variables is independent of another set $Y$ given a third set $Z$. The idea is to associate "dependence" with "connectedness" (i.e., the existence of a connecting path) and "independence" with "unconnected-ness" or "separation". The only twist on this simple idea is to define what we mean by "connecting path", given that we are dealing with a system of directed arrows in which some vertices (those residing in $Z$) correspond to measured variables, whose values are known precisely. To account for the orientations of the arrows we use the terms "d-separated" and "_d-connected" (d connotes "directional").

## Do calculus

## Exposure
An exposure is a variable that an independent variable that is the subject of interest ion intervention or action that is introduced, typically intentionally but can be accidental that perturbs a system of interconnected variables.

## Identification


## Mediation

## Parent
A variable $X$ is a parent of variable $Y$ if there is a unidirectional path connecting $X$ to $Y$.
