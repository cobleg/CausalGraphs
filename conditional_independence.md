# Definition of conditional independence
$X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent given $Z$. This is written as $X \perp \!\!\! \perp Y  |  Z$. This means that once $Z$ is known, $Y$ provides no extra information about $X$. 

An equivalent definition is: $p(x|y,z)=p(x|z)$ for all $x$, $y$ and $z$.
