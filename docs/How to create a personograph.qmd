## Overview

A [personograph](https://github.com/joelkuiper/personograph) is a pictographic representation of relative harm and benefit from an intervention. The idea is to use icons to represent features of a given dataset.

## Notes

The folllowing notes are relevant:

-   A custom icon can be used. This requires importing an icon via the package [grImport](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/grImport/grImport.pdf).

-   The custom icon must be a postscript file. The format `.eps` works

## Code

Example 1: Personograph from the personograph documentation

```{r}
library(personograph)
data <- list(first=0.89, second=0.06, third=0.05)
# With colors
personograph(data, n.icons=64, dimensions=c(8, 8), colors=list(first="grey", second="blue", third="red"),
             fig.title = "Example of a personograph")

```
