Inverse probability weighting is a method to reduce bias in causal inference studies caused by a[confounder](Glossary.md##Confounder).

Inverse probability weighting is applied by:
- Constructing a [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) model to estimate the probability of exposure observed for a particular person
- Using the predicted probability as a weight in subsequent analysis.
