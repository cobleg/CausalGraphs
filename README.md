# CausalGraphs
This repository contains my notes on causal graphs. Specifically, defining causal graphs and how to apply causal graph concepts to improve the identification of cause-effect relationships. This method will likely assist with the design of machine learning algorithms with the prime objective of improving prediction accuracy with a secondary objective of improved explanations of the predictions. Ultimately, I envisage causal graphs being one of the main ways that data scientists will harness machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Background
These concepts originate from Judea Pearl's work on the [Theory of Causality](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/home.htm), which provides a concise set of mathematical operations for causal learning.

See the [References]([[references]]) page for useful background information about causal graphs.
