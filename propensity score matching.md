# Overview
According to Wikipedia:
> **propensity score matching** (**PSM**) is a [statistical matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(statistics) "Matching (statistics)") technique that attempts to [estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory "Estimation theory") the effect of a treatment, policy, or other intervention by accounting for the [covariates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariate "Covariate") that predict receiving the treatment. PSM attempts to reduce the [bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_(statistics) "Bias (statistics)") due to [confounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding "Confounding") variables that could be found in an estimate of the treatment effect obtained from simply comparing outcomes among [units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_unit "Statistical unit") that [received the treatment versus those that did not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_and_control_groups "Treatment and control groups").
