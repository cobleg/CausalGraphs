D-Separation describes conditional independence in [Directed Graphical Models](Directed_Graphical_Models.md). We can use this in order to determine relationships between random variables if only a subset of the model is observable.

The crucial point in conditional independence is the location of observable nodes in the Directed Graphical Model.


# Using d-separation in analysis
Tips for using d-separation to identify cause-effect relationships:
- Mark the given variables
- Apply basic rules to all triplets
- Check if there is a path between random variables that is not blocked.
