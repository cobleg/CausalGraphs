A time dependent [confounder](Glossary#Confounder) is a confounding variable in which the value of the variable changes over time. Traditional methods of adjustment can cause bias in statistical studies. This is a particular problem where a threshold (e.g. level of dosing in a medical treatment) is involved. 

Feedback between outcome and confounder further complicates the bias.

# Examples
In a study on the effect of physical activity on knee pain, previous knee pain can act as a confounder for the effect of current physical activity on knee pain.

# Methods of adjustment

Methods of adjustment that reduce this type of bias are:
- inverse probability of treatment weighting
- parametric G formula
- G estimation
